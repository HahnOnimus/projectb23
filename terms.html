                    <h2>3. Potential Future Equity Conversion</h2>
                    <h3>3.1 Conversion Opportunity</h3>
                    <p>At our sole discretion, BVaaS may offer pre-order participants the opportunity to convert their pre-order amounts into equity during a future funding round. Such conversion would be subject to:</p>
                    <ul>
                        <li>Separate conversion agreements</li>
                        <li>Applicable securities laws</li>
                        <li>Company valuation at time of conversion</li>
                        <li>Approval by BVaaS management</li>
                    </ul>
                    
                    <div class="highlight-box">
                        <p><strong>Exclusive Benefit:</strong> If offered, pre-order participants may receive an unprecedented 90% discount on equity conversion compared to standard investors at the time of conversion. This represents a potential once-in-a-lifetime opportunity for early supporters.</p>
                        <p><strong>Slot Conversion Example:</strong> If at the time of equity issuance, 1 equity slot is valued at ₦2,000,000, and you have 1 slot with an up to 90% discount, you could convert your ₦200,000 pre-order into equity valued at ₦2,000,000 — a potential 10x valuation, subject to final company decision.</p>
                    </div>
                    
                    <h3>3.2 No Guarantee of Conversion</h3>
                    <p>BVaaS reserves the absolute right to never offer equity conversion to pre-order participants. The decision to offer conversion, the terms of conversion, and the eligibility of any pre-order participant for conversion shall be at the sole discretion of BVaaS.</p>
                    
                    <h3>3.3 Financial Transparency for Equity Holders</h3>
                    <p>Pre-order holders who convert to equity will be given access to the company's balance sheet and key financial metrics upon product launch. This ensures full transparency and allows for accurate ROI tracking based on actual company performance.</p>
